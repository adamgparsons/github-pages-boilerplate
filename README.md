# Github pages boilerplate

A simple boilerplate using Gulp tasks to get up and running quickly in Github pages.

This project uses SASS with an [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/) structure.

## Getting Started


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

I recommend using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/ "Homebrew")

### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js") 

or 

```shell
$ brew install node
```
### [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) 
```shell
$ sudo npm install gulp -g
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

#### 1. Get the latest version  
[Download](https://github.com/btomy/ca-designsystem.git "Download .zip") or clone the latest version of this boilerplate on your local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:adamgparsons/github-pages-boilerplate.git
$ cd github-pages-boilerplate
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
Install our project dependencies and developer tools listed in `package.json`
```shell
$ npm install 
```


#### 3. Start developing
When it's done installing, you can start developing by running:  

```shell
$ npm run serve-docs
```
This command will build a local version of our Jekyll project from the source files into a temporary folder (`_site/`).
